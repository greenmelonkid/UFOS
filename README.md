# UFOS

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this analysis was to allow users more options when entering criteria to search for UFO
sightings. Not only can users search by date, but with the added filters, they can now search by city, state, 
country, and shape too.

## Results

To use the new webpage, all one needs to know is one piece of criteria. Fortunately, if you have a lot of information
about your UFO sighting, there are multiple filters to narrow it down. 

When opening the webpage, you'll notice a list of sightings organized by date. Because the list is so long, you 
will see filters on your left where you can enter any criteria you know in the search bar to see your results. 
There are search boxes for the date, city, state, country, and shape. 

If you have all of the criteria, it would be beneficial to filter by all criteria, but if you only know the date 
and state for example, that's ok! You are able to search with either one or up to five search criteria. Once 
you've entered your criteria, you press enter and all results matching your search will come up! 


## Summary

I would say the biggest drawback is that the criteria search bars are too open ended. What I mean by that is, 
as a user, I wouldn't know what was supposed to be entered into the boxes. I tried testing a few cities and none of 
them came up because I was writing out the full name of the state and country, as I'm sure most people would. All of
the cities, state, country code, are written in lower case letters, so if the user types any capital letters, 
nothing will come up. I also would not know what the options for shape were. It would be more helpful to have a 
drop down menu with options, so it would be less confusing.
